# Dirty-Clothes Image Classifier

This project aims to classify images of clothes as either "implemented" (with coffee stains) or "not implemented" (without coffee stains) using image processing and machine learning techniques. The classifier can assist in quality control or sorting processes where stained or unstained items need to be identified.

## Project Overview

The **Dirty-Clothes Image Classifier** is a machine learning model designed to detect and classify coffee-stained areas on clothes. This project involves:
- Deploying a video-based classification approach.
- Detecting and categorizing images with or without coffee stains.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies images based on the presence of coffee stains.
- **Image Processing**: Applies Canny edge detection for identifying stain patterns.
- **File Organization**: Organizes classified images into designated folders.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OsmanByrm/Dirty-Clothes-Image-Classifier.git
   cd Dirty-Clothes-Image-Classifier
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main classification script:
   ```bash
   python src/classifier.py
   ```
2. The classifier will process images, detect coffee stains, and organize them into respective folders.

## Model and Methodology

The model uses **Canny edge detection** for edge-based stain identification. Images are classified into two categories:
- **Implemented**: Contains coffee stains.
- **Not Implemented**: Does not contain coffee stains.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of images with and without coffee stains, organized as follows:
- **Implemented**: Images with coffee stains.
- **Not Implemented**: Images without coffee stains.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more sophisticated image processing algorithms for improved stain detection.
- Expand the dataset with more stain types.
- Optimize the model for real-time detection.
